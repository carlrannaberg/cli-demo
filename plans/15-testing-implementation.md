# Plan for Issue 15: Testing Implementation

This document outlines the step-by-step plan to complete `issues/15-testing-implementation.md`.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Testing Setup
- [ ] Install Jest and testing dependencies
- [ ] Configure Jest for TypeScript
- [ ] Set up ink-testing-library
- [ ] Create test directory structure
- [ ] Configure test scripts in package.json

### Phase 2: Unit Tests
- [ ] Test AgentStore actions and state
- [ ] Test UIStore actions and state
- [ ] Test individual component rendering
- [ ] Test utility functions
- [ ] Test keyboard input handlers

### Phase 3: Integration Tests
- [ ] Test navigation between views
- [ ] Test issue execution flow
- [ ] Test command palette functionality
- [ ] Test modal interactions
- [ ] Test state persistence

### Phase 4: E2E Tests
- [ ] Test complete user workflows
- [ ] Test keyboard shortcut sequences
- [ ] Test error scenarios
- [ ] Test edge cases
- [ ] Add coverage reporting

## Technical Approach
- Use Jest as testing framework
- ink-testing-library for component testing
- Mock file system operations
- Test keyboard inputs with simulated events

## Potential Challenges
- Testing terminal-specific behaviors
- Mocking Ink components properly
- Testing async state updates
- Simulating keyboard events

## Code References
- Component examples throughout spec can be used as test bases
- Testing strategy: `specs/feat-interactive-terminal-ui.md:229-248`
