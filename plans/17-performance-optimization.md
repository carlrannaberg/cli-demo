# Plan for Issue 17: Performance Optimization

This document outlines the step-by-step plan to complete `issues/17-performance-optimization.md`.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Component Optimization
- [ ] Identify components needing React.memo
- [ ] Implement memoization for static components
- [ ] Add useMemo/useCallback where appropriate
- [ ] Profile component render performance

### Phase 2: State Management Optimization
- [ ] Implement state update batching in stores
- [ ] Optimize selector usage
- [ ] Reduce unnecessary state updates
- [ ] Add state update profiling

### Phase 3: Output and Input Optimization
- [ ] Implement output buffer limiting
- [ ] Add circular buffer for execution logs
- [ ] Create keyboard input debouncing
- [ ] Optimize event handler performance

### Phase 4: Performance Testing
- [ ] Create performance benchmarks
- [ ] Test with large datasets
- [ ] Profile memory usage
- [ ] Identify and fix memory leaks
- [ ] Document performance best practices

## Technical Approach
- Use React DevTools Profiler
- Implement debounce utility function
- Use circular buffer for logs
- Batch Zustand updates with subscribeWithSelector

## Potential Challenges
- Balancing optimization with code readability
- Testing performance in terminal environment
- Identifying actual vs perceived performance issues
