# Plan for Issue 7: Issue List Component Implementation

This document outlines the step-by-step plan to complete `issues/7-issue-list-component.md`.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Component Setup
- [ ] Create components/IssueList.tsx
- [ ] Import required dependencies and stores
- [ ] Set up component state for filter and selection
- [ ] Connect to AgentStore for issues data

### Phase 2: Filter Implementation
- [ ] Add TextInput component for filtering
- [ ] Implement filter state with useState
- [ ] Create filtered issues logic
- [ ] Update selection index on filter change

### Phase 3: Keyboard Navigation
- [ ] Implement useInput hook
- [ ] Add up/down arrow key handling
- [ ] Add Enter key for execution
- [ ] Ensure selection stays within bounds

### Phase 4: Issue Display
- [ ] Use Static component for issue list
- [ ] Add status indicators (✓/○)
- [ ] Implement selection highlighting
- [ ] Add issue description display

### Phase 5: Actions and Feedback
- [ ] Connect executeIssue action
- [ ] Add completion check before execution
- [ ] Implement toast notifications
- [ ] Add keyboard hint footer

## Technical Approach
- Use Static for efficient list rendering
- Manage selection index locally
- Filter issues in real-time
- Handle edge cases for empty lists

## Visual Layout
```
Filter: [search box]

○ #3 setup-project - Initialize project
✓ #4 create-components - Build UI components
> ○ #5 add-features - Implement features
○ #6 write-tests - Add test coverage

[↑↓] Navigate | [Enter] Execute | [Esc] Back
```

## Potential Challenges
- Selection index management during filtering
- Focus management between input and list
- Handling rapid keyboard inputs
- Empty state handling
