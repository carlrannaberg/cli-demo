# Issue 17: Performance Optimization

## Requirement
Implement performance optimizations to ensure smooth operation with large datasets and prevent memory issues.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] React.memo implemented for static components
- [ ] State update batching in Zustand stores
- [ ] Output buffering for execution logs
- [ ] Keyboard input debouncing
- [ ] Virtual scrolling for large lists (future enhancement prep)
- [ ] Performance profiling and benchmarks
- [ ] Memory leak prevention

## Technical Details
This issue implements the performance considerations outlined in the master plan to ensure the application remains responsive.

### Optimization Areas
- Component re-render prevention
- Efficient state management
- Memory-efficient log handling
- Input handling optimization
- Large dataset handling preparation

## Dependencies
- All component issues should be complete
- Issue #13: Keyboard Shortcuts (for debouncing)
- Issue #4: State Management (for batching)
