# Issue 4: State Management Implementation

## Requirement
Implement the state management layer using Zustand with AgentStore and UIStore as specified in the master plan.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] AgentStore implemented with all specified state and actions
- [ ] UIStore implemented with all specified state and actions
- [ ] Type definitions created for all state interfaces
- [ ] Mock data included for initial testing
- [ ] Stores are properly typed with TypeScript
- [ ] Store actions are tested and functional

## Technical Details
This issue implements the core state management using Zustand, creating two separate stores for separation of concerns:
- AgentStore: Manages agent/issue data and execution state
- UIStore: Manages UI state like active view, modals, and notifications

### Key State Interfaces
- AgentState (issues, execution status, output)
- UIState (active view, overlays, toasts)
- Issue, ProjectStatus, Toast types

## Dependencies
- Issue 3: Project setup must be completed first
